<b>For issues:</b>

* For all issues: Make sure you are using the latest version! If you are using an old modpack, your version is very likely old and you need to update.

* Read all open issues before you post yours - noone benefits from 160 copies of the same bug report.

* If your issue involves a log, please include the full log, not just parts of it.

* If your issue involves a crash, you <i>must</i> include crash report or a loading log (the former is preferred). Please read through the crash report before submitting. This also applies to errors that kick you to the main menu.

* If your issue is something is not working, <i>include explanation and screenshots</i> to rule out user error and to track down potential bugs.

* Please use [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com), [Gist](https://gist.github.com/), or a similar service for posting crash reports, logs, modlists or other long documents.

* Some issues cannot be fixed, or have imperfect fixes given the limitations of Factorio's modding API. Do not request better solutions which cannot be provided.

* Be polite. Don't be demanding.

* Be patient.
